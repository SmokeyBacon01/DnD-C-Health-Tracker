A DnD health tracker that supports complex numbers.

A character's health is now displayed as a complex number and damage/healing is dealt with as vector math.
A character dies when the argument of their health falls between +/- 135 degrees of their current PHASE.
A character's phase is the argument that their damage/healing is in.

Will probably add an undo or history system.
